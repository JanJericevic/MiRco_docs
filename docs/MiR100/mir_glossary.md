# Glossary

**Positions**: Positions are defined as X-Y coordinates with orientation in the map and are used in missions (can also be used outside missions). 

**Marker**: Markers are position types used by the robot to dock to physical V, VL, L, or straight bar-shaped objects. Markers are used when you want the robot to position itself accurately relative to a physical object.
