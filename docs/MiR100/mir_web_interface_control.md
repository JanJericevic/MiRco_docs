# Web interface control

!!! warning
    MiR100 internal clock is prone to desynchronization which can mess with the robot control.  
    First thing you have to do after you connect to the MiR web interface is go to `System -> Settings -> Date & Time` and synchronize the internal clock. Click "load from device" and "Save changes".

!!! note
    For an advanced setup for clock synchronization see this [solution](https://github.com/DFKI-NI/mir_robot?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-chrony-to-synchronize-system-time-automatically).
