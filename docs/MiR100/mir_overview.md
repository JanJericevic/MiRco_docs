MiR100 is an entry-level autonomous mobile robot (AMR) from Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR). 

The platform has a payload capacity of 100 kg and can reach speeds of up to 1.5 m/s. It is equipped with two SICK S300 lidar systems, an Intel RealSense 3D camera and four ultrasonic sensors.

The main robot interface is the [MiR web interface](./mir_web_interface.md). The web interface is used to design robot applications and interact with the robot.

It has an internal computer which acts as the main control system. The internal computer runs a ROS instance that we can [use to control the robot](./mir_ros_control.md).
